    // Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    // paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    // the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    // the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    // resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    // modern systems.
